Below you can see the comparison chart of all VM types. The benchmark results were collected from official Azure documentation and are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/compute-benchmark-scores#about-coremark). The tests were done using [CoreMark](https://www.eembc.org/coremark/faq.php) utility on Linux machines with Ubuntu 18.04. Some VM types have a grey color, meaning that they are Burstable VMs. They should be treated separately because they cannot constantly perform on that level of performance. Please pay attention to the fact that there could be different results in different regions due to differences in regional pricing.

Below you can see the comparison chart of all instance types in the **Iowa /us-central1** region. The benchmark results were collected from official GCP documentation and are available [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/coremark-scores-of-vm-instances). The tests were done using [CoreMark](https://www.eembc.org/coremark/faq.php) utility. Please pay attention to the fact that there could be different results in different regions due to differences in regional pricing.

Below you can find the chart with the average price in USD per hour among the most common VMs in the region. Some VM types were excluded such as G-series, L-series and NV/NC due to their absence in some regions. Choose region and VM size wisely.

To cover hosting and cloud expenses, eliminate ads, and enable the development of new features, we are introducing the **Subscription Tier**. This offering comes with novel tools and features that further aid in optimizing your Azure/AWS/GCP deployments.\n\n#### Free\n\n# $0/month\n\n- AWS, Azure and GCP\n- Specs for each Instance\n- Similar Instances\n- Price/Performance comparison\n\n#### Monthly\n\n# $9.95/month\n\n- View **ALL** best price regions\n- Comparison for **Savings Options**\n- Spot Price History **\\> 3 months**\n- Programmatic **API access**\n- Compare more than 2 Instances\n- VMs recommendations\n- Price/Perf for **Savings Options**\n\n\\\\* and all free tier features\n\nStart free trial\n\n#### Yearly\n\n# ~~$120~~ $79.95/year\n\n- View **ALL** best price regions\n- Comparison for **Savings Options**\n- Spot Price History **\\> 3 months**\n- Programmatic **API access**\n- Compare more than 2 Instances\n- VMs recommendations\n- Price/Perf for **Savings Options**\n\n\\\\* and all free tier features\n\nStart free trial\n\nIf you are interested in accessing data **in bulk** daily, please [contact us](mailto:support@cloudprice.net?subject=bulk access).\n\nPeople from these companies are using CloudPrice.net\n\n![Microsoft](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmicrosoft.1f74105c.png&w=384&q=75)![Intel](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fintel.e8c46c4a.png&w=128&q=75)![Accenture](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Faccenture.9d7c9ed0.png&w=384&q=75)![Associated Press](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fap.31905ccd.png&w=64&q=75)![UBS](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fubs.57bcb5d2.png&w=256&q=75)![Walmart](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fwalmart.fa7aedf6.png&w=256&q=75)![LG](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flg.079ff0a9.png&w=256&q=75)\n\n# Features available with subscription\n\n#### View ALL Best Price Regions\n\nIn the free tier, you can see only the four best regions that offer the cheapest pricing for each instance. The paid tier will give you access to a chart comparing all regions for each instance size, sorted by price.\n\nThat will help you find the cheapest Instance closest to your region. For example difference between Norway West vs West Europe on Azure for same Standard\\_D2\\_v4 is **62%**. On average users optimize their deployments on \\*17-20% only based on choosing correct regions.\n\n\\\\* based on users' feedbacks\n\n![hint](https://cloudprice.net/_next/static/media/bestregions.8b3a38bd.webp)\n\n#### Spot Price History\n\nWith a subscription, you will be able to view and analyze Spot Price History data beyond 3 months. For Azure, the data is available starting from 2022 and varies by instance type. For AWS, data is available starting from early 2024.\n\n![hint](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fspothistory.110cb29a.webp&w=3840&q=95)\n\n#### Savings Options Comparison\n\nIn paid tier you will able to compare all available savings options for particular instance in selected region. For example on Azure you will able to compare across On-Demand, Reservations, Savings Plans, Spot. On GCP between sustainable discounts, 1-3y Commitments. On AWS you will be able to compare across all 26 different options.\n\nPricing for **Reservations** or **Savings Plans** for instances also varies across regions, and you should choose and make reservations in advance. Make sure to select the right region and VM size wisely to avoid unnecessary future changes and wasting money.\n\n![hint](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsavings.8553407c.png&w=3840&q=95)\n\n#### Advanced Comparison Tool\n\nEasily compare **up to 5 instances** at once. Analyze all instance specs line by line, or even the pricing in different regions for these VM types, on a unified comparison screen. Copy and paste the URL with the comparison and share it with your colleagues.\n\n![hint](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcomparisontool.7be90a33.webp&w=3840&q=95)\n\n#### Programmatic API access\n\nAll data available on CloudPrice.net and even more is available through the REST API via our brand new [CloudPrice Developer Portal](https://developer.cloudprice.net) using an API key. Fetch data and use it in your apps and scripts.\n\nThose who need access to the full dataset in bulk without API throttling can use our bulk export functionality. To gain access to bulk export, please [contact us](mailto:support@cloudprice.net?subject=bulk access)\n\n![hint](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapi-access.f18ca085.png&w=3840&q=95)\n\n#### Price/Performance for Reserved 1y-3y\n\nIn the public view, you can see price/performance for virtual machine comparisons across all regions, but only for the pay-as-you-go model. Under subscription, you will get access to data for **Reserved 1-3y** or **Savings plans** payment models. The pricing for each VM is different across regions and payment models, therefore price/performance ratio are be different as well. This will help you find the most valuable VM in a particular region for your reservations.\n\nFor instance using 24 x Standard\\_F2s\\_v2 instead of 1 x Standartd\\_F48s\\_v2 is **more efficient on 9.5%** from price/performance standpoint view with same number of CPU and RAM.\n\n![hint](https://cloudprice.net/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fperformance.aebf3ee0.webp&w=3840&q=95)",

To find the cheapest region, visit the [main page](/aws/ec2). The \"Best Price Region\" is indicated in the corresponding column.\n\nThe latest update occurred onSeptember 18, 2024 at 12:24 AM UTC\n\nHere is the map with all AWS regions [https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions\\_az/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)\n\n| Geography | Region Name | Region | Average price of Instances per hour (USD) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Geography | Region Name | Region | Average price of Instances per hour (USD) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asia Pacific | Asia Pacific (Malaysia) | [ap-southeast-5](/aws/ec2/?region=ap-southeast-5) | 0.06338 |\n| US | US East (Virginia) | [us-east-1](/aws/ec2/?region=us-east-1) | 0.25653 |\n| US | US East (Ohio) | [us-east-2](/aws/ec2/?region=us-east-2) | 0.25653 |\n| US | US West (Oregon) | [us-west-2](/aws/ec2/?region=us-west-2) | 0.25653 |\n| Canada | Canada West (Calgary) | [ca-west-1](/aws/ec2/?region=ca-west-1) | 0.26077 |\n| Asia Pacific | Asia Pacific (Mumbai) | [ap-south-1](/aws/ec2/?region=ap-south-1) | 0.26179 |\n| Europe | Europe (Ireland) | [eu-west-1](/aws/ec2/?region=eu-west-1) | 0.26207 |\n| Canada | Canada (Central) | [ca-central-1](/aws/ec2/?region=ca-central-1) | 0.26584 |\n| Europe | Europe (London) | [eu-west-2](/aws/ec2/?region=eu-west-2) | 0.2667 |\n| Israel | Israel (Tel Aviv) | [il-central-1](/aws/ec2/?region=il-central-1) | 0.26734 |\n| Europe | Europe (Paris) | [eu-west-3](/aws/ec2/?region=eu-west-3) | 0.26933 |\n| Asia Pacific | Asia Pacific (Singapore) | [ap-southeast-1](/aws/ec2/?region=ap-southeast-1) | 0.27139 |\n| US | US West (N.
